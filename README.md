# Regenerative Braking Energy Monitor for E-Bikes

This system measures the amount of energy recovered during regenerative braking in electric bikes.  
Using the INA219 sensor, it calculates charging current, real-time voltage, and total watt-hours sent back to the battery, helping evaluate regen efficiency and battery performance.

### Features
- Real-time current and voltage readings  
- Calculates total recovered watt-hours  
- Detects active regenerative braking  
- Useful for EV performance tuning and battery health study  

### Hardware Required
- Arduino board  
- INA219 Voltage/Current Sensor  
- E-Bike regenerative braking system (simulation or test bench)
